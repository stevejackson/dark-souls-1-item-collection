# Dark Souls 1 Japanese Item Collection

All Dark Souls 1 Items, in Japanese & English, as an Anki deck. Intended usage is for learning Japanese, although it also functions as a way to compare localizations or easily search item descriptions for text.

This repository houses the latest card templates used for that anki deck.
