# Dark Souls 1 Japanese Item Collection

All Dark Souls 1 Items, in Japanese & English, as an Anki deck. Intended usage is for learning Japanese, although it also functions as a way to compare localizations or easily search item descriptions for text.

This repository houses the latest card templates used for that anki deck.

## How to Re-export & Share deck

1. Anki: File -> Export -> Anki Deck Package
  * Include: Dark Souls 1 Items
  * Disable "Include scheduling information"
  * Enable "Include media"
2. Anki: File -> Switch Profile, use a separate profile
3. Anki: File -> Import; import the deck exported above
4. In this new profile, remove the tags `personaltointerval` and `personalskip` for all cards
